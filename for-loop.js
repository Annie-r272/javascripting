/* When this statement is used in a for loop, it can also be known as an  
  accumulator.  Think of it like a cash register's running total while each  
  item is scanned and added up.  For this challenge, you have 10 items and  
  they just happen to be increasing in price by 1 each item (with the first  
  item free!).  */
